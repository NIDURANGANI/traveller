🌍 New Project Completed: Travel App ✈️

 💼 Frontend Developer 

I'm thrilled to share that I recently designed and developed a Responsive Travel App to make trip planning easier and more efficient. The project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Fonts, with a strong focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
